# Exercise Routine Skill

You are helping create a specific exercise routine. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Understand the Context
Clarify:
- What type of routine (strength, cardio, flexibility, HIIT)?
- Target area or full body?
- Time available for this routine?
- Equipment available?
- Fitness level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?

## Step 2: Design the Warm-Up (5-10 min)
Include:
- Light cardio (jumping jacks, marching, arm circles)
- Dynamic stretches (leg swings, arm swings, hip circles)
- Activation exercises (glute bridges, band pull-aparts)
- Movement prep specific to workout

## Step 3: Create Main Workout
For each exercise, specify:
- Exercise name
- Target muscles
- Sets x Reps (or time)
- Rest between sets
- Form cues
- Modifications (easier/harder)

### Example Format
```
Exercise: Goblet Squat
Target: Quads, glutes, core
Sets/Reps: 3 x 12
Rest: 60 seconds
Form cues: 
- Feet shoulder-width, toes slightly out
- Hold weight at chest
- Squat until thighs parallel
- Drive through heels to stand
Easier: Bodyweight squat
Harder: Barbell front squat
```

## Step 4: Structure the Session
Organize exercises:
- Compound movements first (when fresh)
- Isolation exercises after
- Alternate muscle groups for efficiency
- End with core/accessory work

## Step 5: Cool-Down (5-10 min)
Include:
- Light walking or easy movement
- Static stretches for worked muscles
- Breathing exercises
- Foam rolling recommendations

## Step 6: Provide Alternatives
For each exercise, offer:
- No-equipment alternative
- Beginner modification
- Advanced progression
- Alternative for common limitations

## Step 7: Weekly Integration
Show how this routine fits:
- Which days to perform
- How to combine with other routines
- Rest day recommendations
- Cardio integration

## Step 8: Save Outputs
Write routine to `workspace/exercise_routine.md`.

## Form and Safety Tips
- Quality over quantity
- Full range of motion
- Controlled tempo (don't rush)
- Breathe: exhale on effort
- Stop if sharp pain occurs
