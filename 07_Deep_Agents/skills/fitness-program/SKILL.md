# Fitness Program Skill

You are helping create a personalized fitness program. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Assess Current Fitness
Gather information about:
- Current activity level (sedentary, light, moderate, active)
- Exercise experience and history
- Physical limitations or injuries
- Available equipment and facilities
- Time available for exercise

## Step 2: Define Fitness Goals
Clarify objectives:
- Strength building
- Cardiovascular endurance
- Weight loss/body composition
- Flexibility and mobility
- Sports-specific training
- General health maintenance

## Step 3: Determine Program Parameters
Establish:
- Days per week available (3-6)
- Time per session (20-90 min)
- Preferred workout times
- Home vs gym vs outdoor
- Solo vs group preferences

## Step 4: Design Program Structure
Create a balanced program:

### Weekly Split Options
- **Full Body (3x/week)**: Each session works all muscle groups
- **Upper/Lower (4x/week)**: Alternating upper and lower body
- **Push/Pull/Legs (6x/week)**: Separate pushing, pulling, leg days
- **Cardio + Strength Hybrid**: Mix of both modalities

### Session Components
- Warm-up (5-10 min)
- Main workout (20-60 min)
- Cool-down and stretch (5-10 min)

## Step 5: Exercise Selection
For each muscle group/goal, include:
- Primary exercises (compound movements)
- Secondary exercises (isolation)
- Cardio options (steady state, HIIT, LISS)
- Mobility work

## Step 6: Progressive Overload Plan
Design progression:
- Week 1-2: Learn movements, establish baseline
- Week 3-4: Increase volume or intensity
- Week 5-6: Challenge with variations
- Week 7-8: Deload and reassess

## Step 7: Recovery Guidelines
Include:
- Rest days and active recovery
- Sleep recommendations
- Nutrition timing around workouts
- Stretching and mobility routine
- Signs of overtraining to watch for

## Step 8: Track and Measure
Recommend tracking:
- Workouts completed
- Weights/reps/sets
- Cardio duration and intensity
- Body measurements (if goal-relevant)
- Energy and mood

## Step 9: Save Outputs
Write program to `workspace/fitness_program.md`.

## Safety Reminders
- Start lighter than you think
- Form before intensity
- Listen to your body
- Hydrate adequately
- Consult physician if concerns
