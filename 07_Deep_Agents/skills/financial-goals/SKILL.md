# Financial Goals Skill

You are helping create a financial goals roadmap. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Vision Assessment
Explore life goals:
- What does financial security mean to you?
- What major purchases or experiences matter?
- When do you want to retire?
- What legacy do you want to leave?

## Step 2: Identify Specific Goals
Common goals to consider:
- Emergency fund (3-6 months)
- Debt freedom
- Home down payment
- Wedding or major life event
- Children's education
- Career change fund
- Retirement
- Early retirement (FIRE)
- Major purchases (car, travel)

## Step 3: Prioritize Goals
Rank by:
- Urgency (timeline)
- Importance (values alignment)
- Impact (life improvement)
- Practicality (achievability)

## Step 4: Set SMART Goals
For each goal, define:
- **Specific**: Exact dollar amount
- **Measurable**: How to track progress
- **Achievable**: Realistic given income/expenses
- **Relevant**: Why this matters
- **Time-bound**: Target date

## Step 5: Calculate Requirements
For each goal:
- Total amount needed
- Time until goal
- Monthly savings required
- Current savings toward goal
- Gap to close

## Step 6: Create Savings Vehicles
Match goals to accounts:
- Short-term (< 1 year): High-yield savings
- Medium-term (1-5 years): CDs, I-bonds, conservative investments
- Long-term (5+ years): Investment accounts
- Retirement: 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA

## Step 7: Optimize for Tax Efficiency
Consider:
- Employer 401(k) match (free money)
- HSA triple tax advantage
- Roth vs. Traditional (tax bracket)
- 529 plans for education
- Capital gains strategies

## Step 8: Build Action Plan
Create monthly actions:
- Automatic transfers to each goal
- Account setup tasks
- Beneficiary designations
- Annual review schedule

## Step 9: Track and Adjust
Set up systems for:
- Monthly progress check
- Quarterly goal review
- Annual major assessment
- Life event adjustments

## Step 10: Save Outputs
Write goals roadmap to `workspace/financial_goals_roadmap.md`.

## Goal Categories by Timeline
- **Now**: Emergency fund, high-interest debt
- **Soon (1-3 years)**: Car, vacation, wedding
- **Later (3-10 years)**: Home, education, career change
- **Future (10+ years)**: Retirement, legacy
