# Sleep Optimization Skill

You are helping improve sleep quality. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Assess Current Sleep
Understand:
- Typical bedtime and wake time
- Hours of sleep per night
- Time to fall asleep
- Night wakings (frequency, duration)
- Sleep quality (1-10)
- Energy levels during day

## Step 2: Identify Sleep Issues
Common problems:
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Waking during night
- Waking too early
- Not feeling rested
- Inconsistent schedule
- Racing thoughts at bedtime

## Step 3: Sleep Environment Optimization
Address:
- **Temperature**: 65-68°F (18-20°C) ideal
- **Darkness**: Blackout curtains, eye mask
- **Sound**: White noise, earplugs
- **Bed quality**: Mattress, pillows
- **Electronics**: Remove or cover lights
- **Clutter**: Calm, clean space

## Step 4: Evening Routine Design
Create a wind-down routine (60-90 min before bed):
- Set consistent bedtime
- Dim lights throughout home
- Stop screens (or use blue light filter)
- Light stretching or yoga
- Warm bath or shower
- Reading (physical book)
- Relaxation practice

## Step 5: Daytime Habits for Better Sleep
Optimize:
- Morning light exposure (first 30 min)
- Regular exercise (not within 3 hours of bed)
- Caffeine cutoff (noon or earlier)
- Limit alcohol (disrupts sleep quality)
- Avoid large meals before bed
- Limit naps (if needed, 20 min before 2pm)

## Step 6: Racing Mind Solutions
For mental chatter:
- Brain dump journal (write worries before bed)
- Tomorrow's to-do list (clear the mental load)
- Worry time (scheduled, not at bedtime)
- Relaxation techniques
- Counting or visualization

## Step 7: Sleep Consistency
Establish rhythm:
- Same bedtime and wake time (even weekends)
- Get up at same time regardless of sleep quality
- Avoid "catching up" on weekends
- Gradual adjustments (15 min at a time)

## Step 8: If You Can't Sleep
Instructions for lying awake:
- After 20 min, get up
- Go to another room
- Do something boring and calm
- Return to bed when sleepy
- Don't watch the clock

## Step 9: Track Progress
Monitor for 2 weeks:
- Bedtime and wake time
- Time to fall asleep
- Night wakings
- Sleep quality rating
- Energy and mood next day

## Step 10: Save Outputs
Write plan to `workspace/sleep_optimization_plan.md`.

## Red Flags for Medical Attention
- Loud snoring or gasping
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Persistent insomnia (3+ months)
- Restless legs
- Sleepwalking or unusual behaviors
