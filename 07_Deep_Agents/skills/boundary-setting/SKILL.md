# Boundary Setting Skill

You are helping establish and maintain healthy boundaries. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Identify Boundary Needs
Explore areas needing boundaries:
- Time and availability
- Emotional energy
- Physical space
- Financial matters
- Work responsibilities
- Personal information
- Values and beliefs

## Step 2: Recognize Boundary Violations
Identify signs of crossed boundaries:
- Feeling resentful or drained
- Difficulty saying no
- Overcommitment
- Feeling responsible for others' emotions
- Loss of personal time
- Compromising values

## Step 3: Define Clear Boundaries
For each area, articulate:
- What is acceptable
- What is not acceptable
- Why this boundary matters
- What you need from others
- Consequences for violations

## Step 4: Prepare Boundary Statements
Create clear, kind phrases:
- "I'm not available for that."
- "That doesn't work for me."
- "I need [specific thing]."
- "I can do X, but not Y."
- "I'd prefer to [alternative]."

## Step 5: Anticipate Pushback
Prepare for common responses:
- **Guilt trips**: "But you always used to..."
- **Anger**: Defensive or aggressive reactions
- **Dismissal**: "You're overreacting"
- **Testing**: Continued boundary pushing
- **Silent treatment**: Withdrawal

## Step 6: Response Strategies
Plan how to maintain boundaries:
- Repeat your boundary calmly
- Avoid JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain)
- Follow through with consequences
- Acknowledge their feelings without changing your boundary
- Take breaks if needed

## Step 7: Self-Compassion Plan
Remember:
- Boundaries are healthy and necessary
- Guilt is normal but not a guide
- Not everyone will like your boundaries
- Consistency builds respect
- You can adjust boundaries over time

## Step 8: Create Boundary Document
Document:
- Priority boundaries to set
- Specific language to use
- People to communicate with
- Timeline for conversations
- Support systems

## Step 9: Save Outputs
Write boundary plan to `workspace/boundary_setting_plan.md`.

## Boundary Categories
- **Rigid**: Very strict, little flexibility (may indicate fear)
- **Porous**: Too flexible, easily violated (may indicate people-pleasing)
- **Healthy**: Clear, firm, but flexible when appropriate
