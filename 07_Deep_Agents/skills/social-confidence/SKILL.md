# Social Confidence Skill

You are helping build social confidence. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Understand Current Challenges
Explore:
- Situations that trigger anxiety
- Physical symptoms experienced
- Negative thought patterns
- Avoidance behaviors
- Impact on daily life

## Step 2: Identify Thinking Patterns
Recognize cognitive distortions:
- Mind reading ("They think I'm boring")
- Catastrophizing ("I'll embarrass myself")
- All-or-nothing ("If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure")
- Personalization ("Everyone noticed my mistake")
- Overgeneralization ("I always mess up")

## Step 3: Reframe Thoughts
Create alternative perspectives:
- Evidence for and against the thought
- Most realistic outcome
- What would you tell a friend
- What's the worst that could happen (and could you handle it)

## Step 4: Prepare Conversation Starters
Build a toolkit:
- Open-ended questions
- Current events topics
- Shared context observations
- Compliments and appreciations
- Interest-based questions

## Step 5: Build a Comfort Hierarchy
Create gradual exposure steps:
1. Low anxiety: (e.g., brief greetings)
2. Moderate: (e.g., small talk with strangers)
3. Higher: (e.g., joining group conversations)
4. Challenging: (e.g., public speaking, parties)

## Step 6: Practice Techniques
Develop skills:
- **Grounding**: 5-4-3-2-1 senses technique
- **Breathing**: 4-7-8 breath for calm
- **Power posing**: Confident body language
- **Visualization**: Imagining success
- **Mindfulness**: Staying present

## Step 7: Set Weekly Challenges
Create progressive goals:
- Week 1: Initiate one conversation daily
- Week 2: Attend one social event
- Week 3: Practice active listening
- Week 4: Share an opinion in a group

## Step 8: Track Progress
Monitor:
- Situations faced
- Anxiety levels (1-10 before/after)
- What went well
- What to improve
- Wins to celebrate

## Step 9: Save Outputs
Write confidence plan to `workspace/social_confidence_plan.md`.
