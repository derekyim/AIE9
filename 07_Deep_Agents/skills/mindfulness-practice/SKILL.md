# Mindfulness Practice Skill

You are helping establish a mindfulness practice. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Understand Goals
Clarify what user hopes to achieve:
- Stress reduction
- Better focus
- Emotional regulation
- Self-awareness
- Better sleep
- General wellbeing
- Spiritual growth

## Step 2: Assess Experience Level
Determine:
- Any previous meditation experience
- Attempts that didn't work (and why)
- Beliefs or concerns about meditation
- Time available daily
- Preferred style (guided, silent, movement-based)

## Step 3: Choose Practice Style
Match personality to approach:
- **Breath awareness**: Focus on breathing
- **Body scan**: Attention through body parts
- **Loving-kindness**: Cultivate compassion
- **Walking meditation**: Mindful movement
- **Mantra**: Repeat word or phrase
- **Visualization**: Guided imagery
- **Open awareness**: Observe thoughts without focus

## Step 4: Start Simple
Beginner-friendly approach:
- Start with 5 minutes daily
- Same time each day (morning recommended)
- Comfortable seated position
- Simple breath counting or awareness
- Use guided meditations initially

## Step 5: Create Practice Routine
Design specific practice:

### Morning Practice (5-20 min)
1. Sit comfortably
2. Set timer
3. Close eyes, settle
4. Focus on breath
5. When mind wanders, gently return
6. End with intention for the day

### Brief Check-ins (1-2 min)
- Before meals
- During transitions
- When stressed
- Before important meetings

## Step 6: Handle Common Challenges
Address:
- "I can't stop thinking" → Thoughts are normal; practice is noticing
- "I fall asleep" → Try earlier, eyes slightly open, sitting up
- "It's boring" → Try different styles; boredom is interesting
- "I don't have time" → Start with 5 min; everyone has 5 min
- "I'm not good at it" → There's no failing; showing up is success

## Step 7: Build Mindful Moments
Integrate into daily life:
- Mindful eating (one meal per day)
- Mindful walking (short distances)
- Mindful listening (in conversations)
- Single-tasking practice
- Pause before responding

## Step 8: Progressive Plan
Week-by-week development:
- Week 1-2: 5 min daily, guided meditation
- Week 3-4: 10 min daily, try different styles
- Week 5-6: 15 min daily, add mindful moments
- Week 7-8: 20 min daily, establish sustainable practice

## Step 9: Resources
Recommend:
- Apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, Waking Up)
- Books ("Wherever You Go, There You Are")
- Local classes or groups
- Retreat options for deepening

## Step 10: Save Outputs
Write practice plan to `workspace/mindfulness_practice_plan.md`.

## Mindfulness Reminders
- Consistency beats duration
- Judgment-free awareness
- Every session is valid
- Progress isn't always linear
- The goal is presence, not perfection
