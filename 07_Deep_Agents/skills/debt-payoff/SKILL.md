# Debt Payoff Skill

You are helping create a debt payoff plan. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Inventory All Debts
Document each debt:
- Creditor name
- Current balance
- Interest rate (APR)
- Minimum payment
- Due date
- Type (credit card, student loan, car, etc.)

## Step 2: Calculate Debt Metrics
Analyze:
- Total debt amount
- Total minimum payments
- Average interest rate
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Monthly cash available for extra payments

## Step 3: Choose Payoff Strategy
Compare methods:

### Avalanche Method (Mathematically Optimal)
- Pay minimums on all debts
- Put extra money toward highest interest rate
- Saves the most money over time
- May take longer to see progress

### Snowball Method (Psychologically Motivating)
- Pay minimums on all debts
- Put extra money toward smallest balance
- Quick wins build momentum
- May pay more interest overall

### Hybrid Approach
- Start with a quick win (small balance)
- Then switch to avalanche

## Step 4: Build the Payoff Schedule
Create a month-by-month plan showing:
- Starting balance
- Payment amount
- Interest paid
- Remaining balance
- Payoff date

## Step 5: Find Extra Money
Identify additional funds:
- Budget optimization
- Side income opportunities
- Selling items
- Tax refunds
- Bonuses
- Reduced expenses

## Step 6: Consider Optimization
Explore:
- Balance transfer cards (0% intro APR)
- Debt consolidation loans
- Refinancing options
- Negotiating with creditors
- Hardship programs

## Step 7: Avoid New Debt
Set guardrails:
- Remove credit cards from wallet/apps
- Freeze cards (literally or figuratively)
- Create a "pause before purchase" rule
- Use cash or debit only

## Step 8: Track Progress
Create tracking system:
- Monthly balance updates
- Visual progress chart
- Celebration milestones
- Payoff countdown

## Step 9: Post-Payoff Plan
Plan for after debt-free:
- Redirect payments to savings
- Build emergency fund
- Start investing
- Lifestyle inflation awareness

## Step 10: Save Outputs
Write payoff plan to `workspace/debt_payoff_plan.md`.
