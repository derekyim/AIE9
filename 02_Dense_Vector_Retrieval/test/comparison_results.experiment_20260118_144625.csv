1. Following a healthy eating plan: Learning to balance what you eat and drink is crucial for managing blood sugar levels.
2. Getting regular physical activity: Engaging in consistent exercise helps control blood sugar and supports overall health.

Together, healthy eating and regular physical activity help many people manage their blood sugar levels effectively, potentially reducing or delaying the need for diabetes medications (Source 1 and Source 3).

Additionally, it's important to regularly check blood sugar levels as advised by your healthcare provider, and to monitor blood pressure and cholesterol to stay within healthy targets, although these are more medical management aspects (Source 1).

- Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where lung irritants may be present.
- Following an eating plan that meets nutritional needs and engaging in appropriate physical activity to strengthen breathing muscles and overall wellness (Source 1, Source 3).

2. Medications:
- Bronchodilators, which relax muscles around the airways to open them and ease breathing, usually administered via inhalers. In severe cases, inhalers may also include steroids to reduce inflammation.
- Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia to prevent infections since people with COPD are at higher risk.
- Antibiotics to treat bacterial lung infections if they occur (Source 1, Source 2).

3. Oxygen Therapy:
- For people with severe COPD who have low blood oxygen levels, oxygen therapy can help improve breathing. It may be needed continuously or only during certain times (Source 1, Source 2).
