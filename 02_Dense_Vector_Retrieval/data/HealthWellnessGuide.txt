The Personal Wellness Guide
A Comprehensive Resource for Health and Well-being

PART 1: EXERCISE AND MOVEMENT

Chapter 1: Understanding Exercise Basics

Exercise is one of the most important things you can do for your health. Regular physical activity can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities.

The four main types of exercise are aerobic (cardio), strength training, flexibility, and balance exercises. A well-rounded fitness routine includes all four types. Adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per week.

Chapter 2: Exercises for Common Problems

Lower Back Pain Relief
Lower back pain affects approximately 80% of adults at some point in their lives. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises can help alleviate discomfort and prevent future episodes.

Recommended exercises for lower back pain include:
- Cat-Cow Stretch: Start on hands and knees, alternate between arching your back up (cat) and letting it sag down (cow). Do 10-15 repetitions.
- Bird Dog: From hands and knees, extend opposite arm and leg while keeping your core engaged. Hold for 5 seconds, then switch sides. Do 10 repetitions per side.
- Partial Crunches: Lie on your back with knees bent, cross arms over chest, tighten stomach muscles and raise shoulders off floor. Hold briefly, then lower. Do 8-12 repetitions.
- Knee-to-Chest Stretch: Lie on your back, pull one knee toward your chest while keeping the other foot flat. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs.
- Pelvic Tilts: Lie on your back with knees bent, flatten your back against the floor by tightening abs and tilting pelvis up slightly. Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 8-12 times.

Neck and Shoulder Tension
Desk work and poor posture often lead to neck and shoulder tension. These exercises can provide relief:
- Neck Rolls: Slowly roll your head in a circle, 5 times in each direction.
- Shoulder Shrugs: Raise shoulders toward ears, hold for 5 seconds, then release. Repeat 10 times.
- Chest Opener: Clasp hands behind back, squeeze shoulder blades together, and lift arms slightly. Hold for 15-30 seconds.
- Chin Tucks: While sitting or standing tall, pull your chin back to create a "double chin." Hold for 5 seconds, repeat 10 times.

Chapter 3: Building a Workout Routine

Starting a new exercise routine can feel overwhelming. The key is to start slowly and gradually increase intensity and duration over time.

Beginner Weekly Schedule:
- Monday: 20-minute walk + 10 minutes stretching
- Tuesday: 15 minutes bodyweight exercises (squats, push-ups, planks)
- Wednesday: Rest or gentle yoga
- Thursday: 20-minute walk + 10 minutes stretching
- Friday: 15 minutes bodyweight exercises
- Saturday: 30-minute recreational activity (swimming, cycling, hiking)
- Sunday: Rest

Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed on the body during exercise training. This can be achieved by increasing weight, reps, sets, or decreasing rest time between sets.

PART 2: NUTRITION AND DIET

Chapter 4: Fundamentals of Healthy Eating

A balanced diet provides your body with the nutrients it needs to function properly. The key components include:

Macronutrients:
- Carbohydrates: Primary energy source. Choose complex carbs like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
- Proteins: Essential for muscle repair and immune function. Good sources include lean meats, fish, eggs, legumes, and dairy.
- Fats: Necessary for hormone production and nutrient absorption. Focus on healthy fats from olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fatty fish.

Micronutrients:
- Vitamins: Organic compounds needed in small amounts. Eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables.
- Minerals: Inorganic elements like calcium, iron, and zinc. Found in whole foods, dairy, and leafy greens.

Chapter 5: Meal Planning for Wellness

Effective meal planning saves time, reduces stress, and helps maintain a healthy diet.

Weekly Meal Planning Steps:
1. Review your schedule for the week and identify busy days
2. Choose 3-4 main dishes that can provide leftovers
3. Plan for healthy snacks to avoid impulse eating
4. Create a detailed shopping list organized by store section
5. Prep ingredients in advance when possible

Sample Day of Balanced Eating:
- Breakfast: Overnight oats with berries and nuts
- Mid-morning snack: Apple with almond butter
- Lunch: Grilled chicken salad with mixed greens and olive oil dressing
- Afternoon snack: Greek yogurt with honey
- Dinner: Baked salmon with roasted vegetables and quinoa
- Evening: Herbal tea

Chapter 6: Hydration

Water is essential for virtually every bodily function. The general recommendation is to drink 8 glasses (64 ounces) of water daily, though individual needs vary based on activity level, climate, and body size.

Signs of dehydration include:
- Dark yellow urine
- Fatigue and low energy
- Headaches
- Dry mouth and skin
- Dizziness

Tips for staying hydrated:
- Start your day with a glass of water
- Carry a reusable water bottle
- Set reminders on your phone
- Eat water-rich foods like cucumbers, watermelon, and oranges
- Drink a glass of water before each meal

PART 3: SLEEP AND RECOVERY

Chapter 7: The Science of Sleep

Sleep is crucial for physical health, mental well-being, and cognitive function. During sleep, your body repairs tissues, consolidates memories, and releases hormones that regulate growth and appetite.

Adults typically need 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Sleep occurs in cycles of about 90 minutes, alternating between REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep.

The four stages of sleep:
- Stage 1: Light sleep, easy to wake, lasts 5-10 minutes
- Stage 2: Body temperature drops, heart rate slows, prepares for deep sleep
- Stage 3: Deep sleep, difficult to wake, body repairs and regenerates
- REM Sleep: Brain is active, dreams occur, important for memory and learning

Chapter 8: Improving Sleep Quality

Sleep hygiene refers to habits and practices that promote consistent, quality sleep.

Essential sleep hygiene practices:
- Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends
- Create a relaxing bedtime routine (reading, gentle stretching, warm bath)
- Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet
- Limit screen exposure 1-2 hours before bed
- Avoid caffeine after 2 PM
- Exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime
- Limit alcohol and heavy meals before bed

Creating an optimal sleep environment:
- Temperature: 65-68 degrees Fahrenheit (18-20 Celsius)
- Darkness: Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask
- Quiet: Consider white noise machines or earplugs
- Comfort: Invest in a quality mattress and pillows

Chapter 9: Understanding and Managing Insomnia

Insomnia is difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking too early. It affects approximately 30% of adults at some point.

Types of insomnia:
- Acute insomnia: Short-term, often triggered by stress or life events
- Chronic insomnia: Long-term, occurring at least 3 nights per week for 3 months or more

Natural remedies for better sleep:
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)
- Relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation
- Herbal teas such as chamomile or valerian root
- Magnesium supplements (consult healthcare provider first)
- Meditation and deep breathing exercises

PART 4: STRESS MANAGEMENT AND MENTAL WELLNESS

PART 5: BUILDING HEALTHY HABITS

Chapter 13: The Science of Habit Formation

Habits are behaviors that become automatic through repetition. Understanding how habits form can help you build positive routines and break negative ones.

The habit loop consists of three components:
- Cue: A trigger that initiates the behavior
- Routine: The behavior itself
- Reward: The benefit you get from the behavior

Tips for building new habits:
- Start small (commit to just 2 minutes initially)
- Attach new habits to existing ones (habit stacking)
- Make the habit obvious and easy to do
- Track your progress
- Be patient - habits take an average of 66 days to form

Chapter 14: Morning Routines for Wellness

How you start your morning sets the tone for the entire day. A intentional morning routine can boost productivity, energy, and mood.

Sample wellness morning routine:

Heart disease - risk factors
Email this page to a friend Print Facebook X Pinterest
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. CHD is also called coronary artery disease. Risk factors are things that increase your chance of getting a disease or condition. This article discusses the risk factors for CHD and things you can do to lessen your risk.

What is a Risk Factor?
A risk factor is something about you that increases your chance of getting a disease or having a certain health condition. Some risk factors for CHD you cannot change, but some you can. Changing the risk factors that you have control over may help you live a longer, healthier life.

Risk Factors you Cannot Change
Some of your CHD risk factors that you CANNOT change are:

Your age. The risk for CHD increases with age.
Your sex. Men have a higher risk of getting CHD than women who are still menstruating. After menopause, the risk for women gets closer to the risk for men.
Your genes or race. If your parents had CHD, you are at higher risk. African Americans, Mexican Americans, American Indians, Hawaiians, and some Asian Americans also have a higher risk for heart problems.
Risk Factors you can Change
Some of the risk factors for CHD that you CAN change are:

Not smoking. If you do smoke, quit.
Controlling your cholesterol through diet, exercise, and medicines, if needed.
Controlling high blood pressure through diet, exercise, and medicines, if needed.
Controlling diabetes through diet, exercise, and medicines, if needed.
Exercising at least 30 minutes a day.
Keeping to a healthy weight by eating healthy foods, eating less, and joining a weight loss program, if you need to lose weight.
Learning healthy ways to cope with stress through special classes or programs, or things like meditation or yoga.
Limiting how much alcohol you drink to 1 drink a day for women and 2 a day for men.
Good nutrition is important to your heart health and will help control some of your risk factors.

Choose a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Choose lean proteins, such as chicken, fish, beans and legumes.
Choose low-fat dairy products, such as 1% milk and other low-fat items.
Avoid sodium (salt) and fats found in fried foods, processed foods, and baked goods.
Eat fewer animal products that contain cheese, cream, or eggs.
Read labels, and stay away from "saturated fat" and anything that contains "partially-hydrogenated" or "hydrogenated" fats. These products are usually loaded with unhealthy fats.
Follow these guidelines and the advice of your health care provider to lower your chances of developing CHD.

A healthy diet is an important factor in reducing your risk for heart disease.

Function
A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce your risk for:

Heart disease, heart attack, and stroke
Conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, including high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity
Other chronic health problems, including type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and some forms of cancer
This article makes recommendations that can help prevent heart disease and other conditions that can affect the health of your heart. People who currently have a heart condition such as heart failure or other health problems such as diabetes, should talk with their health care provider about what type of diet is best. You may need to make certain changes to your diet that are not included in these recommendations.

Recommendations
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

Fruits and vegetables are part of a heart-healthy diet. They are good sources of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Most are low in fat, calories, sodium, and cholesterol.

Eat 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day.

Get more fiber by eating whole fruits instead of drinking juice.

Fruits and vegetables
GRAINS

Choose whole-grain foods (such as whole-wheat bread, cereal, crackers, and pasta or brown rice) for at least half of your daily grain intake. Grain products provide fiber, vitamins, minerals, and complex carbohydrates. Eating too many grains, especially refined grain foods (such as white bread, pasta, and baked goods) can cause weight gain.

Limit high-fat baked goods such as butter rolls, cheese crackers, and croissants, and cream sauces for pasta. Avoid packaged snacks that contain partially hydrogenated oils or trans fats.

EATING HEALTHY PROTEIN

Meat, poultry, seafood, dried peas, lentils, nuts, and eggs are good sources of protein, B vitamins, iron, and other vitamins and minerals.

Fish in diet
You should:

Eat at least 2 servings of low-mercury fish per week.
Cook by baking, broiling, roasting, steaming, boiling, or microwaving instead of deep frying.
For the main entree, use less meat or have meatless meals a few times a week. Get protein from plant-based protein foods instead.
Milk and other dairy products are good sources of protein, calcium, the B vitamins niacin and riboflavin, and vitamins A and D.

FATS, OILS, AND CHOLESTEROL

Some types of fat are healthier than others. A diet high in saturated and trans fats causes cholesterol to build up in your arteries (blood vessels). This puts you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems. Avoid or limit foods that are high in these fats. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats that come from vegetable sources have many health benefits.

Obesity and health
You should avoid or limit foods that are high in saturated fats. Here are some examples:

Foods with a lot of saturated fats include animal products such as butter, cheese, whole milk, ice cream, sour cream, lard, and fatty meats such as bacon.
Some vegetable oils (coconut, palm, and palm kernel oils) also contain saturated fats. These fats are solid at room temperature.
Limit trans fats as much as possible by avoiding hydrogenated or partially-hydrogenated fats. These are often found in packaged snacks and solid margarine.
Think about the following when choosing a margarine:

Choose soft margarine (tub or liquid) over harder stick forms.
Choose margarines with liquid vegetable oil as the first ingredient. Even better, choose "light" margarines that list water as the first ingredient. These are even lower in saturated fat.
Read the package label to choose a margarine that does not have trans fats.
Trans fatty acids are unhealthy fats that form when vegetable oil undergoes hydrogenation.

Trans fats can raise LDL (bad) cholesterol level in your blood. They can also lower your HDL (good) cholesterol level.
To avoid trans fats, limit fried foods, commercial baked goods (donuts, cookies, and crackers), and hard margarines.
OTHER TIPS TO KEEP YOUR HEART HEALTHY

You may find it helpful to talk to a dietitian about your eating choices. The American Heart Association is a good source of information on diet and heart disease. Balance the number of calories you eat with the number you use each day to maintain a healthy body weight. You can ask your doctor or dietitian to help you figure out a good number of calories for you.

Limit your intake of foods high in calories or low in nutrition, including foods like soft drinks and candy that contain a lot of sugar.

The American Heart Association recommends that sodium intake be no more than 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) a day with an ideal limit of no more than 1,500 mg per day for most adults. Cut down on sodium by reducing the amount of salt you add to food when eating and cooking. Also limit packaged foods that have salt added to them, such as canned soups and vegetables, cured meats, and some frozen meals. Always check the nutrition label for the sodium content per serving and be sure to pay attention to the number of servings per container. Season foods with lemon juice, fresh herbs or spices instead.

Foods with more than 300 mg of sodium per serving may not fit into a reduced sodium diet.

Exercise regularly. For example, walk for at least 30 minutes a day, in blocks of 10 minutes or longer. Try to move at least 30 minutes during at least 5 days of the week.

Limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Women should have no more than 1 alcoholic drink per day. Men should not have more than 2 alcoholic drinks each day. One drink is defined as 12 fl ounces [360 milliliters (mL)] of beer, 5 fl ounces (150 mL) of wine, or a 1 1/2-fl ounce (45 mL) shot of liquor.

What is diabetes?
Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy.

If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to serious health conditions. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.

What are the types of diabetes?
There are different types of diabetes:

Type 1 diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. It happens when your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin.
Type 2 diabetes. This is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to insulin. They can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood.
Gestational diabetes. This is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy.
What causes diabetes?
The different types of diabetes have different causes:

Researchers think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and factors in the environment that might trigger the disease.
Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes. The lifestyle factors include not being physically active and being overweight or having obesity.
Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.
Who is more likely to develop diabetes?
The different types of diabetes have different risk factors:

You can develop type 1 diabetes at any age, but it most often starts in childhood. Having a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes may increase your chance of developing it.
You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:
Are overweight or have obesity.
Are over age 35. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older adults.
Have a family history of diabetes.
Have prediabetes. This means that your blood glucose is higher than normal, but it's not high enough to be called diabetes.
Had gestational diabetes.
Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.
Are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander.
Are not physically active.
Have certain other health conditions, such as high blood pressure or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
You are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes if you:
Are overweight or have obesity.
Have a family history of diabetes.
Had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy.
Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.
Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.
What are the symptoms of diabetes?
The symptoms of diabetes may include:

Feeling very thirsty
Feeling very hungry
Urinating (peeing) more often, including at night
Fatigue
Blurry vision
Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands
Sores that do not heal
Losing weight without trying
But it's important to know that your symptoms may vary, depending on which type you have:

The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually come on quickly and can be severe.
With type 2 diabetes, the symptoms often develop slowly, over several years. The symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them.
Gestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild. If you are pregnant, you will usually be screened for this condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.
How is diabetes diagnosed?
To find out if you have diabetes, your health care provider will use one or more glucose blood tests. There are several types, including the A1C test.

What are the treatments for diabetes?
Treatment for diabetes involves managing your blood glucose levels:

If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take daily doses of insulin, either by injection or through a special pump. Some people also need to take another type of diabetes medicine that works with insulin.
If you have type 2 diabetes, you may be able to manage or even reverse it by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, staying at healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity. Some people also need to take diabetes medicines to manage their diabetes.
If you have gestational diabetes, you may be able to lower your glucose levels by eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. But be sure to talk to your provider about your treatment options. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you give birth. But you will have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.
Checking your blood glucose levels is also an important part of managing your diabetes. Ask your provider about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it.

Can diabetes be prevented?
Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented.

You may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes through the same lifestyle changes that are used to manage diabetes (eating a healthy diet, staying at a healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity). These lifestyle changes may also help prevent gestational diabetes.

Summary
Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. With type 1 diabetes, your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.

Type 1 diabetes happens most often in children and young adults but can appear at any age. Symptoms may include:

Being very thirsty
Urinating often
Feeling very hungry or tired
Losing weight without trying
Having sores that heal slowly
Having dry, itchy skin
Losing the feeling in your feet or having tingling in your feet
Having blurry eyesight
A blood test can show if you have diabetes. If you do, you will need to take insulin for the rest of your life. A blood test called the A1C can check to see how well you are managing your diabetes.


What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well. The glucose then stays in your blood and not enough goes into your cells.

Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.

What causes type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors:

Being overweight or having obesity
Not being physically active
Genetics and family history
Type 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.

Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes?
You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:

Are over age 45. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get type 2 diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older people.
Have prediabetes, which means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes
Had diabetes in pregnancy or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.
Have a family history of diabetes
Are overweight or have obesity
Are Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, or Pacific Islander
Are not physically active
Have other conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or depression
Have low HDL (good) cholesterol and high triglycerides
Have acanthosis nigricans - dark, thick, and velvety skin around your neck or armpits
What are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes?
Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at all. If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include:

Increased thirst and urination
Increased hunger
Feeling tired
Blurred vision
Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands
Sores that do not heal
Unexplained weight loss
How is type 2 diabetes diagnosed?
Your health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include:

A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test.
Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.
What are the treatments for type 2 diabetes?
Treatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine:

A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any.
Medicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their diabetes.
You will need to check your blood sugar regularly. Your health care provider will tell you how often you need to do it.
It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels close to the targets your provider sets for you. Make sure to get your screening tests regularly.
Can type 2 diabetes be prevented?
You can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active. If you have a condition which raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, managing that condition may lower your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.


What is Alzheimer's disease?
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people. Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects thinking and memory skills. If you have AD, it can impair your ability to reason or learn new skills until it becomes difficult to complete daily activities.

AD begins slowly over many years. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. It may be mistaken for normal memory changes with aging. However, AD is not a normal part of aging. The brain changes from the disease lead to symptoms that get worse over time.

What are the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?
People with AD may have trouble remembering recent events or the names of people they know. Behavior may vary from person to person and day to day. AD progresses in stages. Late-onset AD occurs in adults aged 65 and older, which is when most people develop the disease. Early-onset AD happens before age 65, which is not common.

Some symptoms of AD can include:

Getting lost in familiar places
Repeating the same question
Not recognizing family members
Having trouble speaking, reading, or writing
Not taking care of yourself, such as not bathing or eating poorly
In AD, over time, symptoms get worse. Later on, people with AD may become anxious or aggressive or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them.

Who is more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease?
Researchers don't fully understand what causes AD. Age is the biggest risk factor. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease. Although people who develop Alzheimer's don't always have a history of the disease in their families.

Researchers believe the causes of AD may be a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, health, and lifestyle factors. Some medical conditions that are associated with a higher risk of AD include:

Hearing loss
Depression
Mild cognitive impairment
Concussion or other traumatic brain injury (TBI)
A related problem, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age. Many, but not all, people with MCI will develop AD.

How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed?
Some health conditions can cause memory loss or symptoms like AD. Talk with your health care provider if you're having noticeable changes in your memory. To determine if your symptoms are related to AD and not normal aging or another health condition, your provider may:

Review your medical history and any medicines you're taking
Conduct tests to check your memory, thinking, and problem-solving skills
Ask about changes in behavior or personality
Do tests to rule out any medical or mental health conditions
Refer you to a provider that specializes in caring for older adults
Recommend a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the brain and nervous system
What are the treatments for Alzheimer's disease?
No treatment can stop the disease. However, some medicines may help keep symptoms from getting worse for a limited time.

Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented?
You can't change some risk factors, like your age. But changing certain lifestyle factors may promote your brain health and help you live a healthier lifestyle overall. This can include to:

Manage chronic health issues such as high blood pressure or hearing loss
Get regular physical activity
Eat a healthy diet
Quit smoking (or don't start)
Get enough sleep
Develop strong social connections

What is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time.

Normally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems:

The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic
The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed
The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed
The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged
What are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
COPD includes two main types:

Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic.
Chronic bronchitis, in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus.
Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.

What causes COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
The cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them.

Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.

Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing COPD.

Who is at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
The risk factors for COPD include:

Smoking. This is the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke.
Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace
Age. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.
Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get COPD are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.
Asthma. People who have asthma have more risk of developing COPD than people who don't have asthma. But most people with asthma will not get COPD.
What are the symptoms of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:

Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot of mucus
Wheezing
A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe
Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity
Tightness in your chest
Some people with COPD get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, COPD can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.

How is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:

A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
Various tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests
Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results.

What are the treatments for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
There is no cure for COPD. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:

Lifestyle changes, such as
Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.
Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants
Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.
Medicines, such as
Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.
Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with COPD are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases
Antibiotics if you get a bacterial lung infection
Oxygen therapy, if you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.
Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include
An exercise program
Disease management training
Nutritional counseling
Psychological counseling
Surgery, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines:
For COPD that is mainly related to emphysema, there are surgeries that:
Remove damaged lung tissue
Remove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing.
For severe COPD, some people may need lung transplant
If you have COPD, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever.

Can COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) be prevented?
Since smoking causes most cases of COPD, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.


What is colorectal cancer?
Colorectal cancer is cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. Your colon and rectum are part of your digestive system:

Your colon is the first and longest part of your large intestine. It absorbs water and some nutrients from foods. It also changes the leftover waste products into stool (poop).
Your rectum is the lower part of your large intestine. It's where your body stores stool.
Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that affects either of these parts may also be called colorectal cancer.

What causes colorectal cancer?
Colorectal cancer happens when there are changes in your genetic material (DNA). These changes are also called mutations or variants. Often, the genetic changes that lead to colorectal cancer happen during your lifetime and the exact cause is unknown. But certain genetic changes that raise your risk for colorectal cancer are inherited, meaning that you are born with them.

Besides genetics, other factors, including your lifestyle and the environment, can affect your risk of colorectal cancer.

Who is more likely to develop colorectal cancer?
Anyone can get colorectal cancer, but certain factors make you more likely to develop it:

Being older; your risk of getting colorectal cancer increases as you age.
Having a personal or family history of colorectal cancer.
Having a history of adenomas. Adenomas are colorectal polyps (growths) that look abnormal under a microscope or are 1 centimeter or larger. Adenomas are not cancer, but they can sometimes turn into cancer over time.
Having a genetic syndrome such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer).
Having chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease for 8 years or more.
Having three or more alcoholic drinks per day.
Smoking cigarettes.
Being Black; Black people have an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer compared to other races.
Having obesity.
What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer?
Colorectal cancer may not always cause symptoms, especially at first. If you do have symptoms, they could include:

A change in bowel habits that lasts more than a few days, such as:
Diarrhea
Constipation
Feeling that the bowel does not empty completely
Your stool is narrower or has a different shape than usual
Blood (either bright red or very dark) in the stool
Frequent gas pains, bloating, fullness, or cramps
Weight loss for no known reason
Fatigue
What is screening for colorectal cancer and who needs it?
Because colorectal cancer may not cause symptoms at first, it's important to have screening tests for colorectal cancer. Screening tests look for signs of a disease before you have any symptoms. They can help find cancer early, when it may be easier to treat.

Most experts recommend that start screenings at 45 and continue until at least age 75. People over 75 and those who are at high risk should talk to their providers about how often you need screening and what type of test they should get.

The types of tests include different stool tests and procedures such as colonoscopies and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Talk with your provider about how often you need screening and what type of test you should get.

How is colorectal cancer diagnosed?
If you have symptoms that could be caused by colorectal cancer or if your screening test results are abnormal, you may need to have more tests to find out if you have cancer. Possible tests include:

A physical exam.
A digital rectal exam. For this exam, your provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel for lumps or anything unusual.
The tests that are also used for screening (colonoscopy, stool tests, etc.) and biopsy, if you have not already had them.
Other blood and tissue tests.
What are the treatments for colorectal cancer?
Your treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, how serious the cancer is, and which type of cancer you have.

For colon cancer, your treatment may include one or more of these options:

Surgery.
Radiofrequency ablation, a procedure that uses radio waves to heat and destroy abnormal cells. The radio waves travel through electrodes (small devices that carry electricity).
Cryosurgery, a procedure in which an extremely cold liquid or an instrument called a cryoprobe is used to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue.
Chemotherapy.
Radiation therapy.
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells.
Immunotherapy.
For rectal cancer, your treatment may include one or more of these options:

Surgery.
Radiation therapy.
Chemotherapy.
Active surveillance, which means having regular tests to see if your rectal cancer has changed. If the tests show the cancer is starting to grow, then you will have treatment to try to cure the cancer.
Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells.
Immunotherapy.
Can colorectal cancer be prevented?
Avoiding the risk factors that you have control over may help prevent some cancers. That includes:

Not smoking
Limiting alcohol to under three drinks per day
Managing your weight
There are also other steps you can take to try to prevent colorectal cancer. They include:

Getting regular colorectal cancer screenings
Having polyps removed before they can become cancerous
Getting regular exercise


You have two kidneys, each about the size of your fist. Their main job is to filter your blood. They remove wastes and extra water, which become urine. They also keep the body's chemicals balanced, help control blood pressure, and make hormones.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means that your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. It can also cause other problems that can harm your health. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of CKD.

The kidney damage occurs slowly over many years. Many people don't have any symptoms until their kidney disease is very advanced. Blood and urine tests are the only way to know if you have kidney disease.

Treatments cannot cure kidney disease, but they may slow kidney disease. They include medicines to lower blood pressure, control blood sugar, and lower cholesterol. CKD may still get worse over time. Sometimes it can lead to kidney failure. If your kidneys fail, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplantation.

You can take steps to keep your kidneys healthier longer:

Choose foods with less salt (sodium)
Control your blood pressure; your health care provider can tell you what your blood pressure should be
Keep your blood sugar in the target range, if you have diabetes
Limit the amount of alcohol you drink
Choose foods that are healthy for your heart: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods
Lose weight if you are overweight
Be physically active
Don't smoke


What is a stroke?
A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.

If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someone's life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery.

What are the types of stroke?
There are two types of stroke:

Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This is the most common type; about 80% of strokes are ischemic.
Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.
Another condition that's similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It's sometimes called a "mini-stroke." TIAs happen when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time. The damage to the brain cells isn't permanent, but having a TIA puts you at much higher risk of having a stroke.

Who is at risk for a stroke?
Certain factors can raise your risk of a stroke. The major risk factors include:

High blood pressure. This is the primary risk factor for a stroke.
Diabetes.
Heart diseases.Atrial fibrillation and other heart diseases can cause blood clots that lead to stroke.
Smoking. When you smoke, you damage your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure.
A personal or family history of stroke or TIA
Age. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older.
Race and ethnicity. People who are African Americans or Hispanic have a higher risk of stroke.
There are also other factors that are linked to a higher risk of stroke, such as:

Alcohol and illegal drug use
Not getting enough physical activity
High cholesterol
Unhealthy diet
Having obesity
What are the symptoms of a stroke?
The symptoms of a stroke often happen quickly. They include:

Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body)
Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
Sudden difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination
Sudden severe headache with no known cause
The F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for if you think someone is having a stroke. Think "FAST" and look for:

Face drooping on one side when smiling.
Arm weakness occurs when the arms are raised, and one arm drifts downward.
Speech is slurred or strange.
Time to call 911.
If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Every minute counts during a stroke.

How are strokes diagnosed?
To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will

Ask about your symptoms and medical history
Do a physical exam, including a check of
Your mental alertness
Your coordination and balance
Any numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs
Any trouble speaking and seeing clearly
Run some tests, which may include
Diagnostic imaging of the brain, such as a CT scan or MRI.
Heart tests, which can help detect heart problems or blood clots that may have led to a stroke. Possible tests include an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiography.
What are the treatments for stroke?
Treatments for stroke include medicines, surgery, and rehabilitation. Which treatments you get depend on the type of stroke and the stage of treatment. The different stages are:

Acute treatment, to try to stop a stroke while it is happening
Post-stroke rehabilitation, to overcome the disabilities caused by the stroke
Prevention, to prevent a first stroke or, if you have already had one, prevent another stroke
Acute treatments for ischemic stroke are usually medicines:

You may get tPA, (tissue plasminogen activator), a medicine to dissolve the blood clot. You can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started. The sooner you can get it, the better your chance of recovery.
If you cannot get that medicine, you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots. Or you may get a blood thinner to keep existing clots from getting bigger.
If you have carotid artery disease, you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery.
Acute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding. The first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain. The next step is to control it:

If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding, you may be given blood pressure medicines.
If an aneurysm is the cause, you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. These are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again.
If an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the cause of a stroke, you may need an AVM repair. An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. An AVM repair may be done through
Surgery
Injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow
Radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM
Stroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life.

Prevention of another stroke is also important, since having a stroke increases the risk of getting another one. Prevention may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines.

Can strokes be prevented?
If you have already had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke, you can make some heart-healthy lifestyle changes to try to prevent a future stroke:

Eating a heart-healthy diet
Aiming for a healthy weight
Managing stress
Getting regular physical activity
Quitting smoking
Managing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels
If these changes aren't enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.


What is depression?
Depression is more than a feeling of being sad or irritable for a few days. It's a serious mood disorder. As one of the most common mental disorders in the United States, depression can affect how you think, feel, and your everyday life. You may not know why you feel this way, but even basic daily activities such as sleeping, eating, or working may become difficult. Depression often needs long-term treatment but getting help at the earliest sign of a problem can help manage your symptoms.

What are the different types of depression?
The most common types of depression are major depression and persistent depressive disorder.

Major depression symptoms include a depressed mood or a loss of interest. Symptoms affect your daily activities and last for at least two weeks.
Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder) has less severe depressive symptoms, but they last longer, usually for at least two years.
Other types of depression can include:

Seasonal affective disorder comes and goes with the seasons. It usually starts in late fall and early winter and goes away during the spring and summer.
Bipolar disorder is sometimes called manic depression. This mood disorder can cause intense mood swings.
Depression with symptoms of psychosis is a severe form of depression that also has delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling something that isn't there).
What causes depression?
There are a variety of things that may cause depression, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Depression can happen at any age and can affect anyone, but it's more common in women. This is often due to the physical and hormonal changes that women have during menstruation, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause. Other mental disorders or chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or heart disease may occur with depression. This may make the chronic condition or depression worse.

In some cases, there is no clear cause for depression.

Who is at risk of depression?
You may be at a higher risk of depression if you have a close relative who has it or another mental health disorder. Going through trauma or stressful life events may raise your risk even more.

What are the symptoms of depression?
Depression doesn't look the same on everyone. The type and number of symptoms of depression can vary and don't always appear like sadness. Depression may affect you differently based on your:

Age. The symptoms of depression may be different in a child, who may appear more irritable than sad. Teens may act out or have excessive sleepiness. The symptoms for an older adult may not be as obvious as other age groups.
Sex. Men often show symptoms and coping behaviors differently than women. Rather than sad, men may appear angry or irritable.
Medical conditions. Some medicines and medical conditions may cause symptoms that look like depression. Chronic conditions may make depression worse.
Symptoms of depression are ongoing and affect your day-to-day life. They can include:

Feeling sad or "empty"
Losing interest in favorite activities
Overeating, or not wanting to eat at all
Sleeping too much, or not enough
Feeling very tired
Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or guilty
Having aches and pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems
Having thoughts of death or suicide
Changing moods or behaviors
Increasing use of alcohol or drugs
Isolating from family and friends
How is depression diagnosed?
If you think you have depression, talk to your health care provider or a mental health provider. To be diagnosed with depression, your provider may use many tools:

A medical history will include asking about your symptoms and family history. To be diagnosed with depression, your symptoms must occur most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. One of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or a loss of interest in most activities.
Medical tests may be done to rule out other medical conditions. Certain medicines and medical conditions (such as viruses or thyroid disorders) may cause symptoms like depression.
A physical exam to make sure another issue isn't causing your symptoms.
A mental health evaluation by your provider or a mental health provider.
What are the treatments for depression?
Depression may need long-term treatment. Most treatments include medicines and/or psychotherapy (talk therapy):

Medicines such as antidepressants may help control your symptoms. You may need to try several medicines to find which works best for you. Medicine may take time to work and can have side effects. Don't stop taking your medicine without first talking with your provider. Contact your provider if you have any concerns about side effects from the medicine.
Psychotherapy (talk therapy) under the care of a mental health provider can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. This may be done one-on-one or in a group setting. It can give you and your family support, education, skills, and coping strategies.
Light therapy has been shown to be effective for seasonal affective disorder (SAD).
Other treatments options may be considered if treatment isn't working or if depression is severe. These may include:
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a brain stimulation procedure that uses a mild electric current when you are under general anesthesia. ECT is most often used for severe depression that is not getting better with other treatments.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves to relieve depression. It's not as powerful as ECT, but with rTMS, you don't need anesthesia. It also has a low risk of negative effects on your memory and thinking.
Can depression be prevented?
Most cases of depression can't be prevented, but healthy lifestyle changes can have long-term benefits for your mental health. These can include:

Getting regular exercise
Having a consistent sleep schedule
Controlling stress
If you, or someone you love is depressed, see your provider or a mental health provider. It's important to get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem.

If you or someone you know has thoughts of hurting themselves or attempting suicide, get help right away. If it is an emergency, dial 911.



What is arthritis?
If you feel pain and stiffness in your body or have trouble moving around, you might have arthritis. Any disorder that affects the joints is often called arthritis. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee.

Most types of arthritis can cause joint pain and inflammation (swelling). Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Some kinds of arthritis can also cause problems in your organs, such as your eyes or skin. Treatment will depend on the type of arthritis you have.

What are the types of arthritis?
Common types of arthritis include:

Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It's often related to aging or injury.
Autoimmune arthritis happens when your body's immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common form of this type of arthritis.
Juvenile arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens in children.
Infectious arthritis is an infection that has spread from another part of your body to the joint. Reactive arthritis is one type.
Psoriatic arthritis affects people with psoriasis (itchy or sore scaly red and white skin patches).
Gout is a painful type of arthritis that happens when too much uric acid builds up in your body. It often starts in the big toe. Other joints can also be affected.
Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis of the spine that can cause stiffness and make it difficult to move and bend.
What are the symptoms of arthritis?
Pain, redness, warmth, and joint inflammation are common arthritis symptoms. You may not be able to move your joint as well as it should. Other symptoms could include fever, weight loss, breathing difficulties, or a rash.

Symptoms often get worse as you age. Some symptoms of arthritis may be signs of other illnesses.

Who is more likely to get arthritis?
A few things that might increase your chance of getting arthritis include:

Family history. You may be more likely to get certain types of arthritis if a member of your family has the disorder.
Age. The risk of getting many types of arthritis increases with age.
Sex. Certain types of arthritis are more common in women, while other types are more common in men.
Other factors that might increase your risk of getting arthritis include having a previous joint injury, obesity, or lupus.

How is arthritis diagnosed?
To find out if you have arthritis, your health care provider may:

Ask you about your medical history, including your symptoms.
Do a physical exam.
Order blood tests or take x-rays.
Your provider may refer you to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in arthritis care) for tests, diagnosis, and care.

What are the treatments for arthritis?
Treatment depends on the type of arthritis you have. It may include medicine or surgery. Your provider will work with you to improve your symptoms and quality of life.

A few ways to help manage your symptoms include:

Hot or cold packs
Relaxation techniques
Use of splints, braces, and/or assistive devices


What is obesity?
Obesity is a disease that means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. Both terms mean that your weight is greater than what's considered healthy for your height.

Body Mass Index (BMI) measures how much you weigh compared to how tall you are. An adult who has a BMI of 30 or more is considered to have obesity. Severe obesity is having a BMI of 40 or higher. Obesity increases your risk for many other diseases and health problems, especially if the extra body fat is carried around the waist.

What raises your risk of obesity?
Obesity happens over time from taking in more calories (through food and drinks) than used up from physical activity and daily living. Your body stores the extra calories as fat. The right balance between calories and activity is different for everyone.

There are many different factors that can affect your body weight. Certain medicines or medical conditions may affect your weight. Other factors include your:

Genetic makeup
Eating habits
Sex
Race or ethnicity
Physical activity level
How is obesity diagnosed?
To find out if you have obesity, your health care provider may:

Ask about your health history, which may include reviewing your weight history, weight-loss efforts, and how physically active you are.
Do a physical exam, which may include checking your height, weight, and vital signs, as well as listening to your heart and lungs.
Order blood tests or other imaging tests, which may include checking any known health problems, as well as for other weight-related diseases and health conditions.
Calculate your BMI, to check your risk for certain diseases. The higher your BMI, the higher your risk. BMI does not distinguish between fat, muscle, and bone mass. It may also overestimate body fat in athletes or those with a muscular build, or underestimate body fat in older persons, or others who have lost muscle.
Check your waist size, since a large waistline, with more body fat around your abdomen (belly) rather than your hips, increases your risk for weight-related health problems.
What health problems can obesity cause?
Having a larger body size can make your heart work harder, put extra pressure on your joints, and may increase your risk for many health conditions, including:

Type 2 diabetes.
Heart disease.
High blood pressure.
Stroke.
Metabolic syndrome.
Osteoarthritis.
Sleep apnea.
Pregnancy problems.
Fertility problems.
Some cancers.
If you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10% of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.

What are the treatments for obesity?
Treatment plans for obesity may depend on your overall weight, other health conditions, and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan.

Your provider can tell you what a healthy weight is for you, help you set goals, and give you tips on how to lose weight. They may refer you to other providers that specialize in nutrition or weight loss to help you make realistic goals and provide support.

Possible treatments may include:

Dietary changes and exercise goals to help you learn how to adopt healthy nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes to lose weight safely and keep it off long term.
Counseling or support groups can give you encouragement and help you understand what's behind weight changes.
Weight-loss medicines to treat obesity.
Weight loss procedures or surgery if you have severe obesity or serious obesity-related health problems and have not been able to lose enough weight.
A healthy lifestyle that includes healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity can help you lose weight and lower your chance of developing complications related to obesity.


What is lupus?
Lupus is a chronic (long-lasting) type of autoimmune disease.Autoimmune diseases happen when your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This attack causes inflammation. It can also damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain.

There are several types of lupus:

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.
Cutaneous lupus affects the skin. It causes a rash or sores, usually after your skin is exposed to sunlight. The two major types of cutaneous lupus are discoid lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus.
Drug-induced lupus is caused by a reaction to some medicines. The symptoms may start 3 to 6 months after starting the medicine. The symptoms usually go away when you stop taking the medicine.
Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is caused by certain antibodies that are passed from the pregnant parent to the baby.
What causes lupus?
The cause of lupus is unknown. Researchers are studying what might cause or trigger the disease, such as:

Genetics
Environmental factors, such as viral infections, sunlight, certain medicines, and smoking
Problems with the immune system
Who is more likely to get lupus?
Anyone can get lupus, but women get it much more often than men.

Lupus is more common in African Americans than in White people. It is also more common in people of American Indian and Asian descent. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.

What are the symptoms of lupus?
Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones are:

Arthritis, causing painful and swollen joints and morning stiffness
Fever
Fatigue or feeling tired often
Red rashes, most often on the face (also called the "butterfly rash")
Chest pain when taking a deep breath
Hair loss
Pale or purple fingers or toes, from cold and stress (Raynaud phenomenon)
Sensitivity to the sun
Swelling in legs or around eyes
Mouth ulcers
Swollen glands
Headache and dizziness
Confusion and memory problems
Symptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare. Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.

What other problems can lupus cause?
Lupus causes inflammation throughout your body. This can cause problems in your organs, including:

Kidney damage (lupus nephritis).
Heart problems, including inflammation in the heart (myocarditis), heart valves, or lining of the heart muscle (pericarditis).
Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis).
Blood clots
Inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the lungs (pleurisy). This can make it painful to breathe.
Some people with lupus may be more likely to develop other conditions, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis.

How is lupus diagnosed?
There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases that cause similar symptoms. So it may take a while to get a diagnosis. To find out if you have lupus, your health care provider:

Will ask about your symptoms, medical history, and family health history
Will do a complete physical exam
May order blood tests, such as ANA (antinuclear antibody), antibodies, complete blood count, and complement tests
May order other tests, such as urine tests
May do biopsies:
Skin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)
Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)
What are the treatments for lupus?
There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.

People with lupus often need to see different providers. You will most likely have a primary care provider and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in diseases of the joints and muscles). Which other specialists you will depend on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus is damaging your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases).

Your primary care provider should coordinate care between all of your other providers and treat other problems as they come up. You and your primary care provider will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You will both review the plan often to make sure that it is working. You should report new symptoms to your provider right away so that your treatment plan can be changed, if needed.

The goals of a treatment plan are to:

Prevent flares
Treat flares when they occur
Reduce organ damage and other problems
Improve your quality of life
Treatments may include drugs to:

Reduce fever, swelling, and pain
Reduce inflammation in your body
Prevent or reduce flares
Reduce or prevent damage to joints
Suppress (lower) the activity of your immune system
Besides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.

Alternative and complementary therapies are therapies that are not part of standard treatments. Some people try alternative and complementary therapies to improve their lupus symptoms. But research has not clearly shown whether these treatments may help or treat lupus. Talk to your provider before trying any new treatments.

How can I cope with lupus?
It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.

It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.



What is celiac disease?
Celiac disease is a chronic (long-term) digestive and immune disorder that damages your small intestine. The damage may prevent your body from absorbing vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from the food you eat. This can lead to malnutrition and other serious health problems

Celiac disease is triggered by eating foods that contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. It may also be in other products like vitamins and supplements, hair and skin products, toothpastes, and lip balm.

Celiac disease is different from gluten sensitivity. Both involve problems with gluten and can cause some of the same symptoms, such as abdominal (belly) pain and fatigue. But gluten sensitivity does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease does.

Wheat allergy, a type of food allergy, is also different. With both celiac disease and wheat allergy, your immune system is reacting to wheat. But with wheat allergy, you can have some different symptoms, such as itchy eyes or trouble breathing. And a wheat allergy will not cause long-term damage to the small intestine.

What causes celiac disease?
The exact cause of celiac disease is not known. Research suggests that celiac disease only happens in people who have certain genes and eat food that contains gluten. Researchers are studying other factors that may play a role in causing the disease.

Who is more likely to develop celiac disease?
Celiac disease is more common if you:

Have a family member who has the disease
Have Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, or Williams syndrome
Are White
Are female
What are the symptoms of celiac disease?
The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. Sometimes the symptoms may come and go. Some people may not notice any symptoms.

Some of the possible symptoms affect your digestive system. Digestive symptoms are more common in children than in adults. The digestive symptoms include:

Bloating (feeling fullness or swelling in your belly)
Chronic (long-term) diarrhea or greasy, bulky, unusually bad-smelling stool (poop)
Constipation
Gas
Lactose intolerance because of damage to the small intestine
Nausea and vomiting
Pain in the abdomen (belly)
Weight loss in adults, or not enough weight gain in children
Some people with celiac disease have symptoms that affect other parts of the body, such as:

Fatigue
Depression and anxiety
Irritability (in children)
Dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy rash with blisters (mainly in adults)
Bone or joint pain
Symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores or dry mouth
What other problems can celiac disease cause?
Over time, celiac disease can cause other health problems, especially if it is not treated. These problems can include:

Malnutrition
Anemia, especially iron-deficiency anemia
Bone loss
Nervous system problems such as headaches, balance problems, or peripheral neuropathy
Reproductive problems, such as missed menstrual periods and miscarriages in women and infertility in men and women
How is celiac disease diagnosed?
If you have symptoms of celiac disease, your health care provider will look for signs that you might have celiac disease. To do this, your provider will get your medical and family history and do a physical exam.

If your provider thinks that you could have celiac disease, you will have some tests. Providers most often use blood tests and biopsies of the small intestine to diagnose celiac disease. The biopsy would be done during an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. For this procedure, your provider uses an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera) to see the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. It also allows your provider to take a sample of tissue for a biopsy.

What are the treatments for celiac disease?
The treatment for celiac disease is following a gluten-free diet for the rest of your life. Sticking with a gluten-free diet will treat or prevent many of the symptoms and other health problems caused by celiac disease. In most cases, it can also heal damage in the small intestine and prevent more damage.

Your provider may refer you to a registered dietician (a nutrition expert) who can help you learn how to eat a healthy diet without gluten. You will also need to avoid all hidden sources of gluten, such as certain supplements, cosmetics, toothpaste, etc. Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten. If a label doesn't tell you what is in a product, check with the company that makes the product for an ingredients list. Don't just assume that a product is gluten-free if it doesn't mention it.
