    "Async will allow us to dispatch jobs without waiting for them to complete.  This allows us to call abuild_from_list and not wait for any particular job to finish.  These return inPython a Coroutine object aka a Promise or a Future.  Its just a handle to be referenced or await'ed or .then()'d if in typescript.  \n",

    "The reason we should bother with the async is eventually EmbeddingModel.async_get_embeddings gets called wtih an array of text chunks, and each of these needs to go to the OpenAI API.  Since wer'e dispatching a lot of API calls, we should do them concurrently to get a result much faster than if we launched them one by one.

    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicity's sake."

    "* Pinning your production applications to specific model snapshots (like gpt-5-2025-08-07 for example) to ensure consistent behavior\n",
    "* Building evals that measure the behavior of your prompts so you can monitor prompt performance as you iterate, or when you change and upgrade model versions\n",
    "* Reusable prompts could also ensure you always use the same prompts.  Reduces variablility due to whitespace, message order, etc..\n",
    "* if an api supports 'greedy decoding' that will be determnistic.\n",

      "Hello! The \"best\" way to write a loop in Python really depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Generally, Python offers a couple of common loop structures:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For loops** – great for iterating over sequences (like lists, strings, ranges):\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for item in sequence:\n",
      "    # do something with item\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **While loops** – useful when you want to loop until a certain condition is met:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "while condition:\n",
      "    # do something\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a quick tip: When looping over a known sequence or range, a `for` loop is usually cleaner and more Pythonic. For example, to print numbers 0 through 4:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for i in range(5):\n",
      "    print(i)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to loop until a condition changes dynamically, use a `while` loop:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, remember to keep loops simple and avoid unnecessary complexity for readability.\n",

    "**Goal:** Broaden the corpus for better evaluation coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes Made\n",
    "- Added medical data covering the **top 12 diseases in the US**\n",
    "- Each disease includes: treatment options, symptoms, and risk factors\n",
    "- Increases diversity in test scenarios for more meaningful evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addition 2: Test Harness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Enable systematic, reproducible performance evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "- Runs 12 standardized user prompts through the RAG pipeline\n",
    "- Records results to CSV files for comparison\n",
    "- Captures similarity scores for direct evaluation of retrieval quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "| Flag | Default | Purpose |\n",
    "|------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| `QA_MODE` | `True` | Run all 12 prompts instead of single query |\n",
    "| `COMPARE_TO_BASELINE` | `True` | Generate comparison analysis |\n",
    "| `PERFORM_NEW_RUN` | `True` | Generate new results (vs. static compare) |\n",
    "| `BASELINE_FILE` | `results.experiment_baseline.csv` | Reference baseline |\n",

    "- **Results:** `comparison_results.experiment_20260118_144222.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Ada-002 Produces Consistently Higher Scores\n",
    "- Every question shows positive difference (0.21 to 0.36)\n",
    "- Ada-002 scores are **21-36% higher** than text-embedding-3-small\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Score Distribution Differs Significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Score Range | Characteristic |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|----------------|\n",
    "| `text-embedding-3-small` | 0.43 - 0.71 | Spread out |\n",
    "| `text-embedding-ada-002` | 0.81 - 0.91 | Compressed, high |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** Ada-002 produces vectors that are \"closer together\" in embedding space. This is a *calibration difference*, not necessarily a quality difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. All Responses Changed\n",
    "Every row shows \"Change\" — different documents were retrieved or ranked differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis: What Do Higher Scores Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Higher Scores ≠ Better Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher scores from Ada-002 could indicate:\n",
    "- **More semantic clustering** — similar concepts embed closer together\n",
    "- **Less discrimination** — harder to distinguish somewhat-related from highly-related content\n",
    "- **Different training objectives** — models were trained differently\n",
    "\n",
    "### Better Evaluation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of raw similarity scores, compare:\n",
    "- Are Ada-002 responses more **accurate**?\n",
    "- Do they cite **better sources**?\n",
    "- Are there questions where one model clearly **wins**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example — Question 1 (Heart Disease):**\n",
    "- Both models acknowledge missing early warning sign data\n",
    "- Ada-002 response provides **more depth and context**\n",
    "- Ada-002 appears to perform slightly better here\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "- [ ] Test `text-embedding-3-large` vs baseline\n",
    "- [ ] Compare against Ada-002 results\n",

    "- **Results:** `comparison_results.experiment_20260118_144625.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Comparison is not meaningful!**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Euclidean distance is **not normalized** (0-1) like cosine similarity\n",
    "- Raw scores can't be directly compared\n",
    "- Math validates correctly, but metrics measure different things\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance Metrics Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Best For | RAG Applicability |\n",
    "|--------|----------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Cosine Similarity** | Semantic similarity (text) | ✅ **Recommended** |\n",
    "| **Euclidean** | Spatial/geometric data | ❌ Magnitude-dependent |\n",
    "| **Manhattan** | Sparse, high-dimensional data | ❌ Not better than cosine |\n",
    "| **Chebyshev** | Worst-case dimension mismatch | ❌ Rarely useful for text |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cosine Similarity Wins for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ignores Magnitude, Focuses on Direction**\n",
    "   - Text embeddings encode *meaning* as direction\n",
    "   - Vector lengths don't matter — only where they point\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalized Comparison**\n",
    "   - Always returns 0-1 range (easy to interpret)\n",
    "   - Not affected by document length variations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Optimization**\n",
    "   - OpenAI, Cohere, etc. optimize for cosine similarity\n",
    "   - Other metrics may produce unexpected results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this health/wellness RAG system:\n",
    "1. **Stick with Cosine Similarity** — it's what embedding models expect\n",
    "2. **Focus on higher-impact improvements:**\n",
    "   - Better chunking strategies\n",
    "   - Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)\n",
    "   - Reranking retrieved results\n",
    "   - Improved prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "> The distance metric is rarely the bottleneck in RAG quality. These typically matter more:\n",
    "> - Chunking strategy\n",
    "> - Embedding model choice *(already tested!)*\n",
    "> - Number of retrieved chunks (k)\n",
    "> - Context formatting for the LLM\n",
