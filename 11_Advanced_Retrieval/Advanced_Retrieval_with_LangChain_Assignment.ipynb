Do 10-15 repetitions.\\n- **Bird Dog:** From hands and knees, extend opposite arm and leg while engaging your core. Hold for 5 seconds, then switch sides. Do 10 repetitions per side.\\n- **Pelvic Tilts:** Lie on your back with knees bent, flatten your back against the floor by tightening your abs and tilting your pelvis up slightly. Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 8-12 times.\\n- **Partial Crunches:** Lie on your back with knees bent, cross arms over chest, tighten stomach muscles, and raise shoulders off the floor. Hold briefly, then lower. Do 8-12 repetitions.\\n- **Knee-to-Chest Stretch:** Lie on your back, pull one knee toward your chest while keeping the other foot flat. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs.\\n\\nThese exercises are gentle and specifically aimed at alleviating lower back discomfort.

        "\n",
        "1. We split the full document into large \"parent\" chunks (e.g. 2000 characters).\n",
        "2. Each parent chunk is further split into smaller \"child\" chunks (e.g. 400 characters).\n",

        "5. Instead of returning the child chunks, we return their associated parent chunks.\n",

        "The basic idea is:\n",

        "- **Return** big chunks (richer surrounding context)\n",

        "\n",
        "##### Answer:\n",
        "Since Semantic chunking takes realted ideas and co-locates them in the resulting vector store then the small and highly repetetive ideas will all be near one another.  Their similarity will be very low and the phrases will be interchangeable, which can cause issues like:\n",
        "* with many phrases that are almost the size, you may get them into one large chunk with no similarity or if they are broken apart into different chunks they may be abitrarily broken since theres no clear signal on how to break them.\n",
        "* if the phases are very short they don't have much signal, so the embedding carries less distinctive information.  The difference between real meaning and random noise is hart to detect.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few ways to adjust:\n",
        "* If the content is fixed size then you can try to break every Q&A into one chunk by itself, and avoid random splits and mixing chunks.\n",
        "* Lower the similarity threshold (or use a percentile-based breakpoint). Instead of a fixed cosine similarity cutoff, split at relative drops — e.g., wherever similarity falls below the 25th percentile of all adjacent-pair scores in the document. This adapts to the narrower range of similarity values you see in repetitive content.\n",
        "* Group by structural cues. Something like an FAQs will have clear question/answer pairs. If we Pre-process with regexp markers (question marks, heading tags, numbered items) before applying any semantic logic then semantic chunking becomes a second pass to merge pairs rather than the primary segmentation strategy.\n",
        "* Increase the window size. Instead of comparing single sentences, compare rolling windows of 2–3 sentences. This gives the embeddings more context and produces more differentiated vectors, making real topic boundaries easier to detect.\n",

        "- **Semantic chunking** leads on 3 of 6 metrics (answer relevancy, factual correctness, faithfulness) - strongest overall on generation quality. Included for completeness - realizing this is not itself a retrieval strategy.\n",
        "- **Ensemble** is a strong contender - perfect context recall (1.0), 2nd in faithfulness (0.725) and factual correctness (0.684). Combines the strengths of BM25 keyword matching with dense vector retrieval.\n",
        "- **Naive, Multi-Query, and Ensemble** all achieve perfect context recall (1.0) - but multi-query costs the most ($0.70) and is slowest (455s).\n",
        "- **Parent Document** is the best balance of cost ($0.27), speed (151s), and strong performance across all metrics - a solid all-rounder.\n",
        "- **BM25** is fast and cheap but significantly underperforms on context recall (0.41) and answer relevancy (0.70) - keyword matching alone misses semantically relevant content.\n",
        "- **Contextual Compression (Rerank)** lands in the middle of the pack on most metrics despite being cost-efficient ($0.29, 212s).\n",
